N3FJP ® Time Mapper UDP Bridge Installer Guide

This document explains how to install and run the N3FJP to Time Mapper UDP Bridge using the
provided Python bridge script and PowerShell installer.

Files Included
• n3fjp_to_timemapper_udp.py – Python bridge (TCP ® UDP)
• Install-N3FJPTimeMapperBridge.ps1 – PowerShell installer

Prerequisites
• Windows 10 / 11
• Python 3.9+ installed (with py launcher)
• N3FJP Logger with TCP API enabled (port 1100)
• Time Mapper UHD with UDP Logger Feed (port 12060)

Installation Steps
1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download Python Install Manager if you do not have Python on your computer
2. Run Python Install Manager
3. TIf you are prompted with the following message:
   
   Windows is not configured to allow paths longer than 260 characters.

   Python and some other apps can exceed this limit, but it requires changing a
   system-wide setting, which may need an administrator to approve, and will
   require a reboot. Some packages may fail to install without long path support
   enabled.
   Update setting now? [y/N] 
   
4. Enter in: y and press enter. Continue with install
5. Create folder: C:\N3FJP_Proxy
6. Copy both files (n3fjp_to_timemapper_udp.py and Install-N3FJPTimeMapperBridge.ps1) into the folder that you just created
7. Run your N3FJP Software Log. Go to "Setting" -> "Application Program Interface (API) at the bottom
8. Click on the box next to "TCP API Enabled (Server) Port 1100. You are now done with the setup on the N3FJP software
9. Open PowerShell as Administrator (right click on your windows icon at the bottom of your screen and select "Terminal (Admin)" or “PowerShell (Admin)”
10. Go to directory C:\N3FJP_Proxy in PowerShell by using this command: cd c:\N3FJP_Proxy
11. Run this command, this allows the program to be installed: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
12. Run Install-N3FJPTimeMapperBridge.ps1 with this command, this installs the program: .\Install-N3FJPTimeMapperBridge
13. It will take a couple minutes for the full install. Once you see the below output, then it's fully installed

14. Restart your computer
15. Start your Time Mapper software and click on the square (top right of your screen and go to "Settings"
16. Go to the "Logger Feed" tab and make sure that the UDP Receive IP is 127.0.0.1 and Port is 12060
17. Exit out of settings and click on "Layers", go to "Ham Radio" and checkmark "Ham Radio > Logger Feed"
18. Click on "Ham Radio > Logger Feed". Under "Additional Layer Features" select your choice of UDP feed
19. Exit out of "Layers" so that your map is visible. Type in IL to open the infobar logger feed
20. Go back to your N3FDP software and enter in a call sign for testing. Click "Log Contact"
21. If all goes well you should see in Time Mapper Logger Feed, info of the call sign you enter and on the map 

Quick Verification

Open C:\N3FJP_Proxy\bridge.log

You should see:
Connected.
Sent SETUPDATESTATE TRUE
RX SETUPDATESTATERESPONSE VALUE=TRUE

Log a test contact in N3FJP

You should see SENT UDP -> 127.0.0.1:12060

If something doesn't go right or if you have trouble, please send me an email: novey.ars@gmail.com
After the install and in c:\N3FJP_Proxy a file will be created called Bridge.Log. This log can be opened
with notepad and if there is a UDP connection or possible error, it will show in this log.
If your system can not detect your N3FJP IP address or if it changes, you can manually enter this info into
config.json which will be in the c:\N3FJP_Proxy folder. The format is as follows:

    "N3FJP_HOST":  "192.168.1.43",
    "N3FJP_PORT":  1100,
    "MYCALL_FALLBACK":  "",
    "UDP_DEST_IP":  "127.0.0.1",
    "UDP_DEST_PORT":  12060,
    "LOG_PATH":  "C:\\N3FJP_Proxy\\bridge.log",
    "Updated":  "2026-01-12T09:06:19"

If the bridge does not connect, ensure Windows Firewall allows outbound TCP connections on port 1100.

Python Path
The installer automatically detects Python using the py launcher. Users do not need to hard-code a
Python path.

Scheduled Task Behavior
